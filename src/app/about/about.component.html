                    My name is Rahul Kumar, and I enjoy <span class="default-highlight">turning data into intelligent solutions</span>.

                    I am a Machine Learning Engineer from Delhi, India. Fluent in both Hindi and English, I bridge cultural and technical divides through code.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">My journey in technology began during my B.Tech at Delhi Technological University, where I discovered my passion for <span class="default-highlight">algorithms</span> and <span class="default-highlight">problem-solving</span>. What started as academic curiosity quickly evolved into building real-world systems - like my COVID vaccination prediction app that achieved <span class="default-highlight">92% accuracy</span> during the pandemic.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at Mphasis as a Software Engineer, while establishing myself as a <span class="default-highlight">Kaggle Expert</span> in competitive data science.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    My toolkit spans <span class="default-highlight">machine learning</span> (Python, TensorFlow), <span class="default-highlight">data engineering</span> (SQL, Tableau), and <span class="default-highlight">full-stack development</span> (Angular, Java). I've built fraud detection systems with <span class="default-highlight">98% recall</span>, predictive health analytics for diabetes trends, and contributed to published research on ensemble learning for disease prediction.

                    I have to tell you - while many developers claim passion for technology, my Kaggle Expert status (top 5%) . There's nothing more satisfying than debugging a stubborn algorithm or discovering elegant solutions in documentation.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    This drive led me to complete certifications in <span class="default-highlight">Advanced SQL</span> and <span class="default-highlight">TensorFlow</span> while maintaining active contributions to open-source ML projects. I believe true expertise comes from both <span class="default-highlight">theoretical depth</span> and <span class="default-highlight">hands-on implementation</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="default-p">
                    In addition to coding, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through technical blogging. I regularly <span class="default-highlight">write and publish articles on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@rahul-713" class="default-highlight">Hashnode</a></span> , covering topics like ML system design, tips from real-world projects, and deep dives into algorithms. For me, writing is a way to both teach and reinforce understanding.
                </p>

                <p class="default-p">
                    I'm continuously expanding my skills in <span class="default-highlight">Computer Vision</span> , <span class="default-highlight">Natural Language Processing</span> and <span class="default-highlight">MLOps</span>, with the goal of building scalable, ethical AI systems. Whether it's refining model accuracy or designing robust data pipelines, I'm driven by creating <span class="default-highlight">technology that delivers measurable impact</span>.
                </p>
                
                <p class="default-p">
                    At the intersection of <span class="default-highlight">data science</span> and <span class="default-highlight">software engineering</span>, I find my sweet spot - transforming raw potential into elegant solutions that push what's possible.
